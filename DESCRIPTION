Description: This dataset contains borehole forensic pumping test data, capturing key
    parameters related to groundwater extraction, borehole performance, and
    water quality assessments. It includes information on the test conditions,
    water levels, pumping rates, flow measurement methods, and water quality
    indicators such as pH, turbidity, and electrical conductivity. The dataset
    also documents permissions granted for testing, equipment used, and
    observations on borehole performance.
